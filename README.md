# ms-sensors
Inspired on Linux lm-sensors, monitor your CPU and GPU thermals consuming [LibreHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor) [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibreHardwareMonitorLib/0.9.2-pre158) to achive this dream.

# Advice 
- Highly recommend to compile your self as your needs, in my case, I've displayed the processor model, the iGPU name and current temperature from both chips. (Ryzen SoC);

PS: needs to run as admin to get CPU and thermals correctly!
